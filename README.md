  <b>Javascript Webapp Framework</b>
  <br /><br />
  <div style="width: 100%; text-align: justify;">
    Welcome to DaniJS, a simple to install and even more simple to use Javascript webapp framework! <br />
    To get started, <b>CLONE</b> the repo or <b>DOWNLOAD</b> the ZIP archive for this project.
    Once that's completed, <br />
    <ul>
      <li><b><i>FOR ZIP</i></b>: Extract the files to a reachable web directory. I.E. Apache Webserver -> "/htdocs" or "/var/www/html"</li>
      <li><b><i>FOR CLONED</i></b>: Place the files in a webserver directory I.E Apache Webserver -> "/htdocs" or "/var/www/html"</li>
    </ul>
    <br />Once the files are in the correct location to be served, simple open up the root directory where they have been stored with your favorite text editor. From there you will be able to see the example source code and review how DaniJS works. The included "examplemodule" HTML files can safely be removed once you get the hang of the framework.

    <b><h2>F.A.Q</h2></b><br />
    <h3>Q: What does DaniJS do?</h3>
    <h4>DaniJS provides a simple to install, simple to use method for organizing and displaying web content in a browser.</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: What's the difference between DaniJS and REACT?</h3>
    <h4>The DaniJS framework is lighter than REACT and utilizes more straightforward ways to organize and display your content</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: Are you trying to replace frameworks like REACT and Angular?</h3>
    <h4>Haha! Absolutely not. There's no way I could. This project is best viewed as a lighter alternative to those guys in situations where you don't need that level of depth or overhead. I see it like this: There is a time for REACT, Angular, etc and a time for DaniJS.</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: Does DaniJS require 3rd party software like jQuery?</h3>
    <h4>No. Everything that is required is included in the repo; however, DaniJS <b>can</b> integrate with other libraries such as MaterializeCSS and jQuery</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: Why does my content display random " > " signs?</h3>
    <h4>This is a known glitch that I'm trying to work out. For now, the easiest way to fix it is by adding a single trailing space after your closing tags within your custom modules.</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: Why can't I see my added module when calling the view its in?</h3>
    <h4>This typically happens because the requested module couldn't be found. Consult the browsers console for more information</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: DaniJS states a module was loaded but I can't see it's content. Why?</h3>
    <h4>Make sure that you don't have styling in a separate module that is overwriting styling in the module in question.</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: Why aren't my images loading after I've added them to a module?</h3>
    <h4>Make sure your paths are correct. Remember that DaniJS loads data from a single entry point. Your modules can live in a separate directory from the index page. Relative paths such as "../" in a module file will <b>NOT</b> refer to the directory one level up from the module itself. Entering a path of "/" in a module will actually be the document root for the domain and not the module's parent directory.</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: Can I use DaniJS in my commercial project?</h3>
    <h4>You are absolutely free to use DaniJS in any project you like, even if you financially benefit from it. You may also modify the software to your hearts content. There is absolutely no warranty or liability on my end, though. It's a "use at your own risk" type deal. Having said that, if you do use DaniJS, I'd love to get a link to your project so I can see how the framework is doing!</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: How do I *insert specific thing here*?</h3>
    <h4>I'm working on a Wiki for the framework. Eventually I'll have it here so you can look things up. In the meantime, I can try my best to answer questions via some social links or something: Twitter: @brandonthebasic</h4>
    <br />
    <h3>Q: HEY! WHY DOESN'T *insert specific thing* WORK RIGHT!?</h3>
    <h4>Probably because it's broken. This project was just a hobby of mine in my off time. I'm still working on it and trying to make it better. You can see for yourself in the source code that there really isn't THAT much to this framework. I'm not even sure it fits the definition of a framework. I appreciate your interest, though. Reach out and I can try my best to help you.</h4>
