## Supported Versions

I utilize a versioning convention similar to Ubuntu. That is, the version of software released will always be stamped with a version in the format of "YY-MM", whereas the YY is the 2 digit year and the MM is the 2 digit month the version was released. Any alterations to the intial release will be minor and unlisted in the version number. 
<br />
The initial release of this software was "22.02" <br /><br />
Below is the version chart showing which version is currently in cycle.<br />
| Version | Current            | Alpha              | Beta               |
| ------- | ------------------ |--------------------|--------------------|
| 22.02   |                    | :white_check_mark: |                    |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
At the moment there isn't a way to report issues. I'm working on that, however, and it will be up as soon as time allows.
